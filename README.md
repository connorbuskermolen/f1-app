This is a website that is sort of like an index for formula 1 and will be a place to get quick information and statistics.
I started this project as a way to practice and build on my skills as well as learn more about the sport.
My next steps are to optimize the site for mobile as well as other various screen size for a better user experince
as well as finish off some of the missing pages that are classified under 'mechanical failure'
Once those steps are done I plan to create pages for the current pages that are pointing to the actual F1 site.

Added in some missing pages, as well as integrated a sign in and sign up component with user authentication using Firebase.
Next steps are to continue to add pages as well as fix up any styling errors and allow pages to fit to different screen sizes.
